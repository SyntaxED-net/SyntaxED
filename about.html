    <h1 class="heading"> History </h1>
    <p> SyntaxED used to be a website that teaches people multiple programming languages, but in 2025 we have decided to only teach and focus on Python! and infact SyntaxED used to be called "NexBit" but since the domain was taken
        we changed it to SyntaxED, the meaning of the word "SyntaxED" is that Syntax is a coding fundamental and ED stands for Education! SyntaxED was originated in March 30th 2025

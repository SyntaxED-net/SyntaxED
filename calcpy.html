            <h1 class="center"> Basic Calculator Project (Python) </h1>
            <p class="center"> A calculator is a tool that can be used to perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll build a basic calculator using <strong> Python </strong> giving you a way to understand how logic, user input, <br> 
                and simple functions work together. The recommended course for this project will be the <i> Python Beginner Course! </i><a href="./python.html">Python Beginner Course</a>  </a> <br><br> for this course we recommend to use a different code editor than our code editor you can use VS code or Pycharm, 
                or anything of your choice!
            </p>
            
            <p class="center">
                First we need to ask user for an input of what arithmetic operator they want to perform calculations on and in order to do that we use the built in <strong>input()</strong> function and we need to ask them,
                "Choose an operator to perform an operation" which the code for that would be:
                <strong>input("Choose an operator to perform an operation") </strong>! <br> and we save that input in a variable named "operator" or anything of your choice! and now we ask the user for an another input on what two numbers they are going to be performing operations on,
                so lets make two more integer inputs that are saved in a variable so your code should look something like this for now: <br> <strong>input("Choose an operator to perform an operation")<br> float(input("Enter a nmber:  ")) <br> float(input("Enter another number:  "))</strong><br><br>
                Now lets move on to the Conditional Statements (if statements), now since there are 4 arthimetic operators we are going to require 4-5 Conditional Statements (if statements) checking on what Arthimetic Operator they choose and what are we going to do with it!
                your Conditional Statements should look something like: <br> <strong>if variable_operator == "+": <br> result1 = number1 + number2 <br> print(result1)</strong> <br> that is for addition and now why dont you try for the other Arthemetic Operators! 
                <br>
                Well Well Well..... There we go! we have officialy programmed a Basic Calculator using Python as well as sharpening your skills with Control Flow and Condition Statements!

            <h1> Operations in Python </h1>
            <p> In Python, operations refer to actions performed on data using operatorsâ€”special symbols or keywords that manipulate values,<br> known as operands. These operations are fundamental to programming, enabling tasks like calculations, comparisons, and data manipulation.</p>
            <h3> Types of Operations in Python </h3>    
            <ol>
                <li> Addition (+) ex: 5 + 6 </li>
                <li> Subtraction (-) ex: 5 - 6 </li>
                <li> Multiplication (*) ex: 5 * 6 </li>
                <li> Division (/) ex: 5 / 6 </li>
                <li> Modulus (%) ex: 5 % 6 </li>
                <li> Exponentiation ex: 5 ** 6 </li>
            </ol>
            <p> The operators above are called <strong> Arthemetic Operators </strong> </p>
            <p> Arthemetic Operators are used to perform basic mental math </p>

            <h3> Printing Operations </h3>
            <p> What if we want our answer to our operation to be displayed? </p>
            <p> We use the built-in <strong> print()</strong> function </p>
            <p> For Example:
            <p class= "pictures"> <strong> print(3 + 5) </strong> </p> 
            <p> The output of the code above would be 8 since 3 + 5 is 8! </p>
